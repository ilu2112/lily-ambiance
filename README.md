# lily-ambiance [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/ilu2112/lily-ambiance/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ilu2112/lily-ambiance)

Minimalistic Responsive Wordpress theme created for my own blog. Inspired by Coderwall Template (http://coderwall.com) and Ubuntu Ambiance Gnome Theme.

### Development

Stylesheets have been developed with `Sass` (http://sass-lang.com/) and `compass` (http://compass-style.org/, https://github.com/Compass/compass). Install `compass` and run `compass w` command under `/assets/style` directory.

File gathering all stylesheets is located under `./assets/style/sass/base.scss` and it compiles into `./assets/style/base.css`.
